The Crystal Palace, made of p_1, p_1 for the Great Exhibition in London, p_4;

the Brooklyn Bridge, completed in steel, p_4 ; the Eiffel Tower, made of steel, p_4.

The first two had p_2. Crystal Palace not only served p_1 the Great Exhibition but, being p_1, was transferred afterwards to Sydenham, where it was used for sculpture, painting and architectural exhibits, and for concerts until November 1936, when it burned, a lost symbol of happiness and brotherhood. The Brooklyn Bridge, built to connect the two great boroughs of New York City, reflected the desire to increase real estate values in Brooklyn. The Eiffel Tower, on the other hand, is a case in itself. Built for the Paris Exhibition of 1889, it was meant to provide ostensibly nothing more or less than a magnificent view of Paris. Monsieur Eiffel extolled its utility as a military lookout, the salubrity of the air at its top, its uses as a laboratory to experiment with wind and gravity, but the innerspring to its construction was to demonstrate that France , 100 years after the revolution, was a leader of the technical world, capable of realizing the dream of a tower 300 meters high, almost 1,000 feet. It would be twice as high as the Washington Monument, at that time the tallest structure. Whatever its motivation, the tower in itself was and is totally "useless" from a practical point of view.
